            Once upon a time, there was a <b>beautiful</b> princess named <font color="White">Snow White</font> . She was kind and gentle and a friend to all animals.
            </p>
            <p>
            One day, <font color="White">Snow White</font> met a charming prince. As they sang a song of love together, <font color="White">Snow White</font>'s evil stepmother, the Queen, watched them.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Queen was so jealous of <font color="White">Snow White</font>'s beauty that she ordered her Huntsman to kill the young princess.
            </p>
            <p>
            But the Huntsman couldn't bring himself to hurt <font color="White">Snow White</font>. He told her to run far away so the Queen would never find her.
            </p>
            <p>
            <font color="White">Snow White</font> ran deep into the woods. She was lost and scared but soon found herself in front of a cottage.
            </p>
            <p>
            The princess knocked, but no one was home. She slowly stepped inside.
            </p>
            <p>
            The cottage was a mess! With the help of her forest friends, <font color="White">Snow White</font> cleaned every nook and cranny.
            </p>
            <p>"Maybe whoever lives here will let me stay," said <font color="White">Snow White</font>.</p>
            <p>Upstairs, <font color="White">Snow White</font> found seven little beds. She thought they belonged to children.</p>
            <p>Tired from cleaning, Snow White yawned as she curled up on the beds and fell asleep.</p>
            <p> Meanwhile, the Seven Dwarfs were heading home from a long day of working in a jewel mine. They were anxious to get home to their cottage in the woods.</p>
            <p>The Seven Dwarfs were surprised when they found a princess inside their home!</p>
            <p>When <font color="White">Snow White</font> awoke, she was charmed by the Seven Dwarfs: Dopey, Sneezy, Happy, Grumpy, Doc, Bashful, and Sleepy.</p>
            <p>The Dwarfs wanted to protect the beautiful princess from the evil queen, so they invited <font color="White">Snow White</font> to live with them.</p>
            <p>To celebrate, the new friends sang and danced the night away.</p>
            <p>Back at the castle, the Queen learned that <font color="White">Snow White</font> was still alive.</p>
            <p>Enraged, she made a magic potion to change her appearance. Her plan was to trick the princess.</p>
            <p>After the Dwarfs had set off for work the next day, the Queen, disguised as an old peddler woman, offered <font color="White">Snow White</font> a beautiful red apple.</p>
            <p><font color="White">Snow White</font> took one bite of the apple and fell into a deep sleep. The Queen had poisoned her!</p> 
            <p>When the Dwarfs came home, they chased the Queen to the top of a stormy mountain. Suddenly, lightning hit the mountain, and the Queen fell, never to be seen again.</p>
            <p>But <font color="White">Snow White</font> was still in a deep sleep. The Seven Dwarfs kept watch over her day and night.</p>       
            <p>Finally, <font color="White">Snow White</font>'s Prince Charming arrived. He had been searching everywhere for the beautiful princess he had sung with so long ago.</p>
            <p>The Prince awakened <font color="White">Snow White</font> with Love's First Kiss. The spell was broken! Snow White and the Prince returned to the kingdom and lived happily ever after.</p>
